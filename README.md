# USBEventScan
Lists USB devices installed on a Windows machine whenever one is added or removed. Updates in real-time. Can be useful for debugging a bad connection between a PC and a USB device or to track if USB devices are being inserted into a system while it is unsupervised. 
Source needs to be run in Visual Studio with the Windows 10 SDK installed since it uses Windows APIs.
